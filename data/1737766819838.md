**Title:** "Unlocking the Power of Memoization in Python: Optimizing Recursively-Defined Functions"

**Introduction:**

Memoization is a programming technique that has been widely adopted in various languages to optimize the performance of recursive functions. In this article, we will explore how memoization can be used in Python to speed up recursive functions and improve their computational efficiency. We will also examine a practical example of memoization in action, demonstrating its benefits and limitations.

**What is Memoization?**

Memoization is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This approach is particularly useful for recursive functions, which can lead to redundant computations and slow down the execution of the program. By storing the results of previously computed function calls, memoization reduces the number of times the function needs to be recalculated, resulting in significant performance improvements.

**How Memoization Works in Python:**

In Python, memoization can be achieved using a dictionary to store the function's results. The basic idea is to initially store "None" as the default value for each key in the dictionary, and then update the dictionary as the function is called. When the function is called again with the same inputs, it checks if the result is already stored in the dictionary, and returns the cached result instead of recomputing it.

**Practical Example:**

Let's consider a simple recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This function is prone to redundant computations, as it recalculates the same subproblems multiple times. By adding memoization, we can optimize the function to store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers:

```python
fibonacci_cache = {}

def fibonacci(n):
    if n in fibonacci_cache:
        return fibonacci_cache[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    result = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    fibonacci_cache[n] = result
    return result
```

**Benefits and Limitations:**

Memoization has several benefits, including:

* Reduced computational complexity: By storing the results of previously computed function calls, memoization reduces the number of times the function needs to be recalculated, leading to significant performance improvements.
* Improved scalability: Memoization allows functions to handle larger input sizes without exhausting memory resources.

However, memoization also has some limitations:

* Increased memory usage: Memoization requires storing the results of previously computed function calls, which can lead to increased memory usage, particularly for large input sizes.
* Increased complexity: Adding memoization to a function can introduce additional complexity, as it requires managing the cache and updating the results.

**Conclusion:**

Memoization is a powerful technique for optimizing recursive functions in Python, allowing developers to reduce computational complexity and improve scalability. By understanding how memoization works and when to apply it, developers can write more efficient and effective code. In this article, we demonstrated the benefits and limitations of memoization, and provided a practical example of how to use it to optimize a recursive function.
